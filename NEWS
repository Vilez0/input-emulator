=== input-emulator v0.8 ===



Changes since v0.7:

 * Fix mouse scroll feature

 * Add --type-delay to start option for keyboard

   Makes it possible to configure type delay in milliseconds. Default value
   is 15 ms.

 * Add mouse test example

 * Add mouse and keyboard stress tests

 * Update examples

 * Fix status print of mouse y-max value

 * Use abstract socket for client/server communication

   Use abstract socket for client/server communication instead of a socket
   file. This way we avoid being unable to start the service because of a
   stale socket file being left from a potential crash or if someone killed
   the service without proper shutdown.



Changes since v0.6:

 * Rename mouse actions

   Rename 'mouse click' to 'mouse button'
   Rename 'mouse down' to 'mouse buttondown'
   Rename 'mouse up' to 'mouse buttonup'

   README and code updated accordingly.

   The new mouse action naming follows the keyboard action naming for
   better consistency.



Changes since v0.5:

 * Add meson option to enable runtime debug output

   Add meson option 'enable-debug' which enables runtime debug output when
   set to true. Default value is false.

 * Update README

 * Add mouse and touch config details to status

 * Make communication more robust

   Make communication more robust by reworking the communication transport
   mechanism to use a socket instead of messages queues.

   This should solve the issue of the occasianally missing letters when
   using the keyboard simulator.



Changes since v0.4:

 * Add kbd and mouse example

 * Rename keyboard-test.sh -> kbd-test.sh

 * Fix server/client communication

 * Update README

 * Update keyboard example



Changes since v0.3:

 * Make sure commands are performed synchronously

   When scripting commands, request messages would pile up and overflow the
   message queue resulting in crash or errors. To avoid this we now wait
   for each command to finish (wait for ok response) before firing the next
   command.

 * Fix stop command crash

 * Wait for service to be fully initialized before exit

   To prevent command-line client from making request before service is
   fully initialized.

 * Make sure only one client is talking to server at a time

 * Update kbd example

 * Update README

 * Remove lua script code

   Can be reintroduced if needed. For now everything is perfectly
   scriptable via command-line commands.

 * Add 'mouse scroll <ticks>' command

 * Add bash completion script

 * Add alias_to_key() and more aliases

 * Move code to keyboard



Changes since v0.2:

 * Add more key aliases

 * Add support for 'stop all' command

   Introduce 'stop all' command which will destroy all input devices which
   will make the daemon quit (daemon automatically quits when there are no
   more input devices online to maintain).



Changes since v0.1:

 * Add LICENSE file



v0.1:

First release!

Sponsored by DEIF A/S I have expanded the keyboard-simulator to also
manage creation of virtual mouse and touch input devices through which
high level mouse and touch actions (movement, clicks, gestures, etc.)
can be performed via command-line or script. This is particular useful
for test automation.

Similar actions can be performed with existing tools but they are either
bound to X (eg. xdotool) or operates with low level events
(evemu-create, evemu-event, etc.) which make automation not as easy.

A lot of code and new features have been added - too much to sumarize
here. See the README or man page for more details.

The new changes have resulted in the script feature being broken for
now but it will eventually be fixed.
