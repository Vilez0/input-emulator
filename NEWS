=== input-emulator v0.3 ===



Changes since v0.2:

 * Add more key aliases

 * Add support for 'stop all' command

   Introduce 'stop all' command which will destroy all input devices which
   will make the daemon quit (daemon automatically quits when there are no
   more input devices online to maintain).



Changes since v0.1:

 * Add LICENSE file



v0.1:

First release!

Sponsored by DEIF A/S I have expanded the keyboard-simulator to also
manage creation of virtual mouse and touch input devices through which
high level mouse and touch actions (movement, clicks, gestures, etc.)
can be performed via command-line or script. This is particular useful
for test automation.

Similar actions can be performed with existing tools but they are either
bound to X (eg. xdotool) or operates with low level events
(evemu-create, evemu-event, etc.) which make automation not as easy.

A lot of code and new features have been added - too much to sumarize
here. See the README or man page for more details.

The new changes have resulted in the script feature being broken for
now but it will eventually be fixed.
